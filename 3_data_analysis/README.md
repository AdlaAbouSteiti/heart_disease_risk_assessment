# Data Analysis

## Overview

The data analysis phase of this project involved: First, catigorizing the dataset based on key health indicators, including BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Each variable was divided into specific categories to facilitate the correlation analysis with the risk of heart disease. In addition, the risk percentage were calculated for each combination of categories that helped gaining more insights from the data. By leveraging data analysis techniques and predictive modeling, we aimed to gain insights into the factors influencing heart disease risk and develop a decision tree model for risk assessment.

## Analysis Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and key features. This involved generating summary statistics, visualizing the distribution of variables, and identifying potential patterns or trends.
   
2. **Data Categorization:** to enable finding clear correlation between health indicators and the risk of heart disease.

3. **Heart Disease Risk Percentage Calculation:** based on the data risk percentage of developing heart disease were calculated for each possible combination of the health indicators. 

4. **Correlation Analysis:** Between each health indicator and the risk of developing heart disease percentage.

5. **(Decision Tree:)[`risk_assessment_tree.py`]** A decision tree model was trained using the dataset to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on their health indicators. The decision tree takes input parameters such as BMI category, blood pressure category, and cholesterol level, and provides a percentage likelihood of heart disease risk
