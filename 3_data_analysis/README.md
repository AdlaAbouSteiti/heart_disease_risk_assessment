# Data Analysis

## Overview

The data analysis phase of this project involved exploring the relationship between key health indicators, such as BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, and the risk of heart disease. By leveraging data analysis techniques and predictive modeling, we aimed to gain insights into the factors influencing heart disease risk and develop a decision tree model for risk assessment.

## Analysis Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and key features. This involved generating summary statistics, visualizing the distribution of variables, and identifying potential patterns or trends.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Preprocessed the dataset to create additional features and transform existing variables as needed. This included calculating BMI, categorizing BMI and blood pressure values, and encoding categorical variables for use in the analysis.

3. **Model Development:** Developed a decision tree model to predict an individual's risk of developing heart disease based on their BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the test data.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of the decision tree model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This provided insights into the model's predictive power and its ability to accurately classify individuals at risk of heart disease.
