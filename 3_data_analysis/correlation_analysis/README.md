# Data Analysis

## Overview

In the data analysis phase, the dataset was categorized based on key health indicators, including BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Each variable was divided into specific categories to facilitate correlation analysis with the percentage of heart disease risk.

## Data Categorization

The data was categorized as follows:
- **BMI:** Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese
- **Blood Pressure:** Normal, Elevated, High BP (Stage 1), High BP (Stage 2)
- **Cholesterol Level:** Level 1, Level 2, Level 3

## Correlation Analysis

### Blood Pressure and Heart Disease Percentage

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between blood pressure categories and the percentage of individuals at risk of heart disease. The analysis involved fixing the BMI and cholesterol level to normal and evaluating the impact of different blood pressure categories.

### Cholesterol Level and Heart Disease Percentage

Similarly, the correlation between cholesterol levels and heart disease risk was assessed while keeping BMI and blood pressure categories at normal levels.

### BMI Category and Heart Disease Percentage

The correlation between BMI categories and the likelihood of heart disease was investigated, with blood pressure and cholesterol levels fixed at normal values.

## Findings

Based on the analysis results show a positive correlation between each health indicator and heart disease risk percentage. However it worth mentioning that the highest risk percentage of developing heart disease corresponded unexpectedly to Underweight individuals with High BP (Stage 2) and cholestrol level 3 (90.9) higher than that in obese individuals with High BP (Stage 2) and cholestrol level 3 (83.17). In addition, Underweight individual tend to have heigher risk than expected when accompanied by High BP (Stage 2) or (Stage 1). a possible interpretation is that being underweight tend to amplify the empact of high BP leading to higher risk of developing heart disease. Thus, further investigation is needed to better understand the reasons of such impact.
