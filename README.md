# Heart Disease Risk Assessment

The Heart Disease Risk Assessment project aims to provide individuals with valuable insights into their risk of developing heart disease based on 3 key health indicators. By leveraging data analysis techniques and predictive modeling, this project helps individuals assess their risk factors and make informed decisions about lifestyle modifications and preventive healthcare measures.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with various risk factors contributing to its development. The Heart Disease Risk Assessment project seeks to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools to understand and manage their risk of heart disease effectively.

## Key Features

- Analyzes key health indicators including BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
- Develops a decision tree model to predict an individual's risk of developing heart disease.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to enable individuals to assess their risk of developing heart disease and take proactive steps to mitigate those risks. By understanding their risk factors and receiving personalized recommendations, individuals can make informed decisions about lifestyle changes, diet, exercise, and medical interventions to improve their heart health and overall well-being.

## How to Use

1. **Input Data:** Provide data on key health indicators including BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
2. **Run Analysis:** Utilize the decision tree model to assess the individual's risk of developing heart disease based on the input data.
3. **Take Action:** Based on your result you can make decissions regarding lifestyle modifications, diet change, or consulting specialest.

## Benefits

- **Early Detection:** Enables early detection of elevated risk of heart disease before the onset of symptoms.
