# Problem Identification

## Overview

Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the importance of early detection and risk assessment. This project aims to address the following key problem areas:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Many individuals are unaware of their risk factors for heart disease, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
   
2. **Complexity of Health Indicators**: Assessing heart disease risk based on multiple health indicators, including BMI, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, can be challenging due to their complex interplay.

3. **Data-Driven Approach**: Leveraging data analysis techniques to identify patterns and correlations between health indicators and heart disease risk can provide valuable insights for preventive healthcare strategies.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess an individual's risk of heart disease based on their BMI, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. By identifying high-risk individuals early, healthcare providers can intervene with targeted interventions and preventive measures to reduce the burden of heart disease.

## Significance

Addressing the problem of heart disease risk assessment has significant implications for public health and healthcare delivery:

- **Early Intervention**: Early identification of individuals at high risk of heart disease allows for timely interventions, potentially preventing adverse health outcomes.
  
- **Self Awareness**: Early identification of individuals at high risk of heart disease allows allows them to take wise decissions about their lifestyles potentially preventing adverse health outcomes.
  
- **Public Health Policy**: Insights from this project can inform public health policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of heart disease and promoting healthy lifestyles at the population level.

## Analytical Question

Can machine learning algorithms be leveraged to predict an individual's risk of heart disease based on their BMI, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, and how accurate are these predictions compared to traditional risk assessment methods?
