# Data Collection

## Overview

For this project, data on key health indicators including BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels was collected from a publicly available dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?resource=download). The dataset contains anonymized information on a large cohort of individuals, including their demographic characteristics, medical history, and health metrics relevant to heart disease risk assessment.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?resource=download), where the dataset used for analysis is stored. The dataset comprises structured data in CSV format, allowing for easy import and analysis using data analysis tools and programming languages such as Python.

## Data Cleanliness Check

Before conducting the analysis, the dataset was thoroughly checked for cleanliness to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. This involved:

- Reviewing the dataset for any missing or erroneous values or outliers.
- Verifying the consistency and accuracy of the data entries.
- Assessing the overall completeness and integrity of the dataset.

## Calculating BMI

Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using the following formula:

$$\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\left(\text{Height (m)}\right)^2}$$
